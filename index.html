      <p>
      I am passionate about locksmithing and I vetted the machine that was to behead me. Plus, as I love new technologies, I also attended the first manned hot-air balloon flight in history. Oh and this is me when I was young, I am actually much older! But this portrait is beautiful, isn't it?

        <center><strong><em>Marie-Antoinette of Austria</em></strong></center>
      <br> Yes, she is pretty too! I know what you are thinking: what a beautiful couple they were making! Well, it was a bit complicated between us, but it is still a shame that we were beheaded...</br>

      <h2>Other Special Facts About Me ðŸ‘‘</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I am the <strong>Direct Representative of God</strong> (yeah this is dope).</li>
        <li>My wedding ended with a <strong>deadly stampede</strong> (nearly 130 casualties). I was very shocked and decided to help the victims' families.</li>
        <li>It took <strong>seven years</strong> for my marriage with Marie-Antoinette to be finally consummated. It turned out that a genital malformation seemed to be the cause of my incapacity to fulfill my duty.</li>

      <h2>Our Dates ðŸ“œ</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I was born in <strong>1754</strong> and she was born in <strong>1755</strong>. We were only one year apart!</li>
        <li>We got married in <strong>1770</strong>, 2 days after we first met. We were 16 and 15 respectively.</li>
        <li>We became <strong><em>King and Queen of France</em></strong> in <strong>1774</strong> after the passing of my grandfather Louis XV.</li>
